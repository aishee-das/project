# A statement of our overall goal: {data-background-image="img/gamecontr.png"}

- We will look at the different relationships between the sales (global and region specific) of a game and different factors in its release and success.

- The different factors we look at include genre, platform of release, user and critic score.

- We will look at the correlation between each of these factors and decide on the most influential characteristic in the sales of a game.

# The correlation between genre and sales:

# Conclusion - Haoran


# Hello World

- Click the `Knit` button to compile your presentation

- Make sure to commit and push all resulting files to your GitHub repo

# Using reveal.js

It's possible to have a horizontal sliding transition as well as nest multiple slides to create a vertical stack.

When presenting, you use the left/right arrows to step through the top-level (horizontal) slides. When you arrive at a vertical stack you can optionally press the up/down arrows to view the vertical slides or skip past them by pressing the right arrow.

(click the down key now)

## reveal.js

- The presentation is created using the `reveal.js` package

- You can create a slide show broken up into sections by using the # and ## heading tags

- You can also create a new slide without a header using a horizontal rule (----)

----

- You can also add pauses between content on a slide using (". . .")

. . .

Like this.

...or using "::: fragment"

::: fragment

# Layouts

You can use plain text

- or bullet points

<div>
  <div style="float: left; width: 50%;">or text in two columns</div>
  <div style="float: left; width: 50%;">like this</div>
</div>

because you can combine HTML and Markdown syntax.

<p style="font-size: 8pt; position: absolute; bottom: -5em; width: 100%; text-align: center;">*You can also add footnotes</p>

# Code

```{r boring-regression}
# a boring regression
model <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
tidy(model)
glance(model)
```

# Plots

```{r recode-species, echo = FALSE}
# In this chunk I'm doing a bunch of analysis that I don't want to present 
# in my slides. But I need the resulting data frame for a plot I want to present.
iris_modified <- iris %>%
  mutate(Species = fct_other(Species, keep = "setosa"))
```

```{r plot-iris, echo = FALSE}
# Code hidden with echo = FALSE
# Uses modified iris dataset from previous chunk
# Play around with height and width until you're happy with the look
ggplot(data = iris_modified, mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Sepal.Length, color = Species)) +
  geom_point() + 
  theme_minimal() # theme options: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html

# Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r iris-table, echo = FALSE}
kable(head(iris), format = "html")
```

# Images

```{r castle, echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Image credit: Photo by JÃ¶rg Angeli on Unsplash."}

```

Or you can also include a full page image. See next slide.
